        <h3>Build Climber and Train Stopper</h3>
        <p>It is an age-old formula. One man or a group of men get together and plan to con an entire nation on one idea. What is their modus operandi? Find the loopholes in the system, trade in the grey areas, win the trust of the middle-class by showing them the stars and then take them for a spin by busting those stars into dust as they pocket the ill-gained profits. Deceit, misinformation, and manipulation are the common tricks of the trade. This is by and large the story of every scammer who has gone wrong or…right and are rarely held accountable for their “illicit activities”.</p>
